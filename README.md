# Community repository for exchanging arcade romhacks

## Have an arcade game ...
... you've fixed up the cabinet and it's really awesome except for that one little thing that the game itself does? Attract mode makes annoying noises? Hiscore list is barely shown at all?

Whatever it is, create an issue on this repository and spread the message. It might take a while but there's always someone who can help you. (If you feel the issue is important and needs attention sooner rather than later, there's always the option of getting [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/) involved.)

## Have experience with assembly and emulators ...
... and you're looking for something to do?

Take a look at the issues list and feel free to contribute!
